# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Park Tycoon is a browser-based resource management and creature collection game that combines elements of Ogame-style resource management, idle monster-taming, and simulation management. Players act as park managers who acquire, cultivate, process, and strategically utilize unique creatures called "Livestock." The game features a turn-based progression system where each turn represents one month, with a modular architecture supporting internationalization and future expansion.
