# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add internationalization (i18n) support to the Flask farming game application and implement proper configuration management using INI files. The application currently has hardcoded English strings throughout the codebase and configuration values scattered in the main application file. This enhancement will make the application accessible to users who speak different languages and provide a centralized, maintainable way to manage application settings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the farming game interface in my preferred language, so that I can better understand and enjoy the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display the interface in the user's preferred language
2. WHEN a user changes their language preference THEN the system SHALL update all interface text to the selected language
3. WHEN the system displays messages, labels, or notifications THEN it SHALL use the appropriate translation for the current language
4. IF a translation is missing for a specific text THEN the system SHALL fall back to English as the default language

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all user-facing strings to be externalized from the code, so that I can easily add new languages without modifying the application logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application renders any user-facing text THEN it SHALL retrieve the text from translation files rather than hardcoded strings
2. WHEN a new language needs to be added THEN the system SHALL only require adding new translation files without code changes
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load all available translation files and make them accessible to the templating system
4. IF a translation key is not found THEN the system SHALL log a warning and display the translation key as fallback text

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure application settings through external configuration files, so that I can modify settings without changing the source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read configuration values from an INI file
2. WHEN configuration values need to be changed THEN the administrator SHALL be able to modify the INI file without touching the source code
3. WHEN the INI file contains invalid values THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and log appropriate warnings
4. IF the INI file is missing THEN the system SHALL create a default configuration file and continue running

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select my preferred language from the available options, so that I can customize my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile or settings THEN the system SHALL display a language selection dropdown with available languages
2. WHEN a user selects a different language THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the change and persist the preference
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL remember their previously selected language preference
4. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL detect their browser's preferred language and set it as default if available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration system to support different environments, so that I can have separate settings for development, testing, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL determine the current environment and load the appropriate configuration section
2. WHEN environment-specific settings are defined THEN they SHALL override the default settings
3. WHEN an environment section is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to default configuration values
4. IF sensitive configuration values are present THEN they SHALL be clearly documented as requiring environment-specific overrides
