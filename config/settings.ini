# Farm Manager Game Configuration File
# 
# This file contains configuration settings for the farming game application.
# Settings are organized by environment (development, production, testing).
# 
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
# - Change secret_key and password_salt in production environments
# - Use environment variables for sensitive values in production
# - Ensure this file has appropriate file permissions (600 recommended)
# - Do not commit production secrets to version control
#
# CONFIGURATION HIERARCHY:
# 1. Environment-specific sections override DEFAULT values
# 2. Environment variables can override any setting
# 3. Code defaults are used as final fallback
